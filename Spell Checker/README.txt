This file will show you exactly how to run and execute my program!

Welcome to my Spell Checking Program!

Overview:
The overall goal of this assignment is to file in the dictionary.txt file and store all of the
words within the file into a hashtable. Through further using hashing, the program will take a
user input of a word and through the hash table be able to figure out if the word is found in the
dictionary. If the word is found, the program will return "True" and also list similar words that 
begin with the same first two letters(in the case there are any). If the word is not found, they 
must assume the word is first miss-spelled. Based off of the first letter of the miss-spelled word 
being correct, the program will return a recommended word from the dictionary (only one word). 
If the miss-spelled word is found, then the program will then run the program as if the word was 
never miss-spelled with the returning of "True" and similar words. If the recommended word is not
the word they are looking for, the program will return "False". After this execution, the program
will display in micro-seconds how long the execution took.

Input: 
The user Input for this program will be:
    - the word that needs to be spell checked
    - the Yes or No to the question of if the miss-spelled word is found

Output:
The Output of this program will be the:
    - The ask for the user input
    - "True" or "False" if the word is found or not
    - The question of if the miss-spelled word is found
    - The similar words to the correct word
    - The execution time in micro-seconds

make run:
In order to run this program, simple type "make run" into the terminal and the program will execute.
The output this program will follow

make clean:
After running the program input "make clean" to get rid of the junk files that result from the program.

HAVE FUN!!
